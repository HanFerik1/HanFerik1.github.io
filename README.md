### About Me:

Hello! I am Han and Welcome to my website! I’ve always been drawn to exotic animals, and my love for them has turned my home into a bit of a sanctuary. One of my favorites is my chinchilla, with its soft fur and curious nature. I enjoy learning about the specific needs of each of my pets, making sure they have everything they need to thrive. Whether it’s setting up a perfect habitat or finding the best diet, I take pride in giving them the best care possible. Having these unique animals around brings a sense of joy and fulfillment that’s hard to describe. I'm currently taking AP CS A, and that's what led me to start using GitHub. It's been a great way to manage my code and collaborate on projects, helping me to understand version control and improve my coding skills. GitHub has become an essential tool as I dive deeper into computer science.
