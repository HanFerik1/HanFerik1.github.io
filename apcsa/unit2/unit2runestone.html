    <h3 class="centered" style="color:#191919; font-size:25px; text-align:center;">AP CSA Unit 2: Using Objects</h3>

    <div class="centered">
        <!-- Section 2.1 -->
        <h2 style="color:#191919; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">2.1:</h2>
        <p> - A class defines a new data type (a classification). It is the formal implementation, or blueprint, of the attributes and behaviors of the objects of that class. </p>
        <p> - An object is a specific instance of a class with defined attributes. Objects are declared as variables of a class type. </p>
        <p> - Objects are values created by constructing an instance of a class. </p>
        <p> - Each class defines the attributes its objects have (the properties or what each object knows about itself) and the behaviors (what each object can do). </p>
        <p> - The attributes are written as instance variables in the class, and the behaviors are written as methods. </p>
        <p> - Constructors initialize the attributes in newly created objects. They have the same name as the class. </p>
        <p> - A constructor signature is the constructor name followed by the parameter list which is a list of the types of the parameters and the variable names used to refer to them in the constructor. </p>
        <p> - Actual parameters are the values being passed to a constructor. The formal parameters are set to a copy of the value of the actual parameters. </p>
        <p> - Formal parameters are the specification of the parameters in the constructor header. In Java this is a list of the type and name for each parameter (World(int width, int height)). </p>
        <p> - Call by value means that when you pass a value to a constructor or method, it passes a copy of the value. </p>
        
        <!-- Section 2.2 -->
        <h2 style="color:#191919; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">2.2:</h2>
        <p> - A new object is created with the new keyword followed by the class name (new Class()). When this code executes, it creates a new object of the specified class and calls a constructor, which has the same name as the class. E.g. World habitat = new World(); </p>
        <p> - There can be more than one constructor defined in a class. This is called overloading the constructor. There is usually a constructor that has no parameters (nothing inside the parentheses following the name of the constructor) like the World() constructor above. This is also called the no-argument constructor. The no-argument constructor usually sets the attributes of the object to default values. </p>
        <p> - There can also be other constructors that take parameters like the Turtle(habitat) constructor call above. A parameter (also called actual parameter or argument) is a value that is passed into a constructor. It can be used to initialize the attribute of an object. </p>
        <p> - You can also declare an object variable and initialize it to null (Turtle t1 = null;). An object variable holds a reference to an object. A reference is a way to find the object in memory. It is like a tracking number that you can use to track the location of a package. </p>
        <p> - The parameter list, in the header of a constructor, lists the formal parameters, declaring the variables that will be passed in as values and their data types. </p>
        <p> - When a constructor like Date(2005,9,1) is called, the formal parameters, (year, month, day), are set to copies of the actual parameters (or arguments), which are (2005,9,1). This is call by value which means that copies of the actual parameter values are passed to the constructor. These values are used to initialize the object’s attributes. </p>
        
        <!-- Section 2.3 -->
        <h2 style="color:#191919; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">2.3:</h2>
        <p> - Procedural abstraction allows a programmer to use a method and not worry about the details of how it exactly works. For example, we know that if we hit the brakes, the car will stop, and we can still use the brakes even if we don’t really know how they work. </p>
        <p> - Use dot notation to execute an object’s method. This is the object’s name followed by the dot (.) operator followed by the method name and parentheses: object.method(); </p>
        <p> - A NullPointerException will happen if you try to call an object method on an object variable whose value is null. This usually means that you forgot to create the object using the new operator followed by the class name and parentheses. </p>
        <p> - An object method or non-static method is one that must be called on an object of a class. It usually works with the object’s attributes. </p>
        <p> - A static method or class method is one that doesn’t need to be called on an object of a class. </p>
        
        <!-- Section 2.4 -->
        <h2 style="color:#191919; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">2.4:</h2>
        <p> - Methods define the behaviors or functions for objects. </p>
        <p> - Some methods take parameters/arguments that are placed inside the parentheses object.method(arguments). </p>
        <p> - Values provided in the parameter list need to correspond to the order and type in the method signature. </p>
        <!-- Section 2.5 -->
        <h2 style="color:#191919; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">2.5:</h2>
        <p> - A void method doesn’t return any value, the only point of calling one is because it does something that can be observed by the user or by other code. </p>
        <p> - Methods with a return type of anything other than void are called non-void methods. These methods return a value that the code calling the method can use. And because methods are called on an object, these methods can be used to return values that tell us things about an object’s internal state and Non-void methods typically do not have effects, and are called purely for the value they return. </p>
        <p> - It is up to the caller of a non-void method to do something with the return value, such as assigning it to a variable or using it as part of an expression. </p>
        <p> - The value returned by a method has to match the declared return type of the method. Thus it can only be used where a value of that type is allowed, such as being assigned to a variable of that type. The data type must match the return type of the method. </p>
        
        <!-- Section 2.6 -->
        <h2 style="color:#191919; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">2.6:</h2>
        <p> - Class names in Java, like String, begin with a capital letter. All primitive types: int, double, and boolean, begin with a lowercase letter. This is one easy way to tell the difference between primitive types and class types. </p>
        <p> - Every class knows its parent class. But, in Java, a class can only have one parent. A class can inherit object fields and methods from a parent class. </p>
        <p> - Strings can be added to each other to create a new string using the + or += operator. This is also called appending or concatenating. You can also add any other kind of value to a String with + or += and the other value will be converted to a String automatically. </p>
        <p> - Note that spaces are not added between strings automatically. If you want a space between two strings, then add one using + " " + and variables are never put inside the quotes ("") since this would print the variable name out letter by letter instead of its value. </p>
        <p> - If you are appending a number to a string it will be converted to a string first before being appended. </p>
        <p> - Escape sequences start with a backslash \ and have special meaning in Java. Escape sequences used in this course include \", \\, and \n to print out a quote, backslash, and a new line. </p>
        
        <!-- Section 2.7 -->
        <h2 style="color:#191919; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">2.7:</h2>
        <p> - int length() method returns the number of characters in the string, including spaces and special characters like punctuation. </p>
        <p> - String substring(int from, int to) method returns a new string with the characters in the current string starting with the character at the from index and ending at the character before the to index (if the to index is specified, and if not specified it will contain the rest of the string). </p>
        <p> - int indexOf(String str) method searches for the string str in the current string and returns the index of the beginning of str in the current string or -1 if it isn’t found. </p>
        <p> - int compareTo(String other) returns a negative value if the current string is less than the other string alphabetically, 0 if they have the same characters in the same order, and a positive value if the current string is greater than the other string alphabetically. </p>
        <p> - boolean equals(String other) returns true when the characters in the current string are the same as the ones in the other string. This method is inherited from the Object class, but is overridden which means that the String class has its own version of that method. </p>
        <p> - Remember that substring(from, to) does not include the character at the to index! To return a single character at index i, use str.substring(index, index + 1). </p>
        <p> - We can compare primitive types like int and double using operators like == and < or >, which you will learn about in the next unit. However, with reference types like String, you must use the methods equals and compareTo, not == or < or >. </p>
        <p> - The method compareTo compares two strings character by character. If they are equal, it returns 0. If the first string is alphabetically ordered before the second string (which is the argument of compareTo), it returns a negative number. And if the first string is alphabetically ordered after the second string, it returns a positive number. </p>
        <p> - The substring method returns the string starting at the first index and not including the last index. The method indexOf returns the index of the first place the string occurs. </p>
        
        <!-- Section 2.8 -->
        <h2 style="color:#191919; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">2.8:</h2>
        <p> - Java will actually return the maximum integer value if you try to subtract one from the minimum value. This is called underflow. And, Java will return the minimum integer value if you try to add one to the maximum. This is called overflow. </p>
        <p> - Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. This includes converting an int to an Integer and a double to a Double. </p>
        <p> - Unboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes from the wrapper class to the primitive type. This includes converting an Integer to an int and a Double to a double. </p>
        
        <!-- Section 2.9 -->
        <h2 style="color:#191919; font-size:20px; text-align:center;">2.9:</h2>
        <p> - Math.random() method is used to generate a random number. </p>
        <p> - int abs(int) : Returns the absolute value of an int value. </p>
        <p> - double abs(double) : Returns the absolute value of a double value. </p>
        <p> - double pow(double, double) : Returns the value of the first parameter raised to the power of the second parameter. </p>
        <p> - double sqrt(double) : Returns the positive square root of a double value. </p>
        <p> - double random() : Returns a double value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0 (not including 1.0!). </p>
        <p> - Math.abs takes a single argument, either a double or an int and returns a value of the same type which is the absolute value of the argument. The absolute value is the positive value of the number without its sign or its distance from 0. </p>
        <p> - Math.pow takes two arguments, both doubles and returns a double which is the first argument raised to the power of the second argument. </p>
        <p> - Math.sqrt takes a double argument and returns a positive double value which is the square root of the argument. For example, the square root of 9 is 3 because 3 squared is 9. </p>
        <p> - If you put (int) before the method Math.random then it will just take integer numbers between the range a to b (b is not included) and if we want to include b, then we should add +1 at the end of the random method. </p>
